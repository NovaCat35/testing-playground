# Practice Problem Playground

Originally just a playground for testing with Jest, I also included my solution to a couple of practice problems.
This playground also includes [fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) and [merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) algorithm with recursion.

Happy coding and grinding as usual :9
